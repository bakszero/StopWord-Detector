इण्डीब्लॉगीज

Indibloggies is an annual blog-award website targeted at Indian Blogs and was started as a parody clique on the Bloggies. The site slogan says that it "showcases the best of the Indian blogosphere". The website awards annually blogs written in English as well as Indicblogs (blogs written in Indian language scripts) authored by Indians and the Indian diaspora. 

The site was launched by an Indian blogger Debashish Chakrabarty as a fun venture, "he felt that he wasn't able to read so many good blogs just because he never heard of them". Indibloggies blog was started at free hosting service from Blogger.com in 2003 with many few bloggers contributing with their awards. The Indibloggies website now operates from http://www.indibloggies.org and has an allied blog.

Though the modus operandi has been different each year, the Indibloggies decides the winners in various award categories based on a mix of peer-review from a panel of jurors, public nominations and public voting. From 2005 onwards Indibloggies uses the social book marking site Del.icio.us to solicit category-wide public nominations.
