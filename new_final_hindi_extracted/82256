नेफ्रान

The nephron (from Greek νεφρός – nephros, meaning "kidney") is the basic structural and functional unit of the kidney.[1] Its chief function is to regulate the concentration of water and soluble substances like sodium salts by filtering the blood, reabsorbing what is needed and excreting the rest as urine
