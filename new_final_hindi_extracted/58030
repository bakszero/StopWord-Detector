सममित घटक

विद्युत इंजीनियरिंग में सममित घटकों की विधि (method of symmetrical components) अन्बैलेन्सड तीन फेजी परिपथों के विश्लेषण को सरल बनाने के लिये किया जाता है।

Symmetrical components are most commonly used for analysis of three-phase electrical power systems. If the phase quantities are expressed in phasor notation using complex numbers, a vector can be formed for the three phase quantities. For example, a vector for three phase voltages could be written as

where the subscripts 0, 1, and 2 refer respectively to the zero, positive, and negative sequence components. The sequence components differ only by their phase angles, which are symmetrical and so are formula_2 radians or 120°. Define the operator formula_3 phasor vector forward by that angle.
Note that α = 1 so that α = α.

The zero sequence components are in phase; denote them as:

and the other phase sequences as:

Thus,

where

Conversely, the sequence components are generated from the analysis equations

where
