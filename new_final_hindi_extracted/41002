Mudhsuden Singh Panesar, known as Monty Panesar (born 25 अप्रैल 1982 in Luton, Bedfordshire), is an English cricketer. A left-arm spinner, Panesar plays Test and one-day cricket for England, and played county cricket for Northamptonshire until 2009, when he departed that team and joined Sussex County Cricket Club for the 2010 English county cricket season.[2] He has also played for Lions in South Africa.

Born in Luton to Indian Punjabi Sikh parents, he is the first Sikh to represent a nation other than India in Test cricket.[citation needed] He wears a black patka (a smaller version of the full Sikh turban) while playing and training.[3] He is a crowd favourite in England, and many fans have worn patkas and fake beards while watching him play.[4]

During his early international career Panesar often receives loud cheers whenever he comes on to bat or bowl and when he fields the ball, the latter due to his history of less than skilful fielding. When first selected for England he was widely perceived as being a particularly inept batsman and fielder, which may have contributed to this reception; the TMS commentator Henry Blofeld once accidentally referred to him as Monty Python,[5] a mistake possibly encouraged by his comic reputation. After early success in test cricket, his results declined, leading to him losing his place in 2009.
