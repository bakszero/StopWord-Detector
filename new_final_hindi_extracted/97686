राधा रमन

When Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu visited South India on His tour of the holy places, He visited the Sri Rangam Temple. In front of the Deity He chanted and danced in ecstatic sanskirtana. The head priest of the Sri Rangam Temple, Sri Vyenkata Bhatta was very much impressed with Sri Mahaprabhu’s love of God.

 Gopal Bhatta gave initiation to Gopinath Das, a bramacari who lived with him and rendered him all services.

There are 40 families who are serving sri radharaman deity
